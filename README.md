A simple browser game for practicing Russian vocabulary and grammar. Created using Django Cookiecutter. Similar to Go Fish.
Players put together sentences in Russian asking if their opponent has a certain item.
If the other player has the item they must respond with 'Yes' and the kind of that item that they have.
